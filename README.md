It‚Äôs sometimes not practical to rewrite your entire application in Flutter all at once.
In such case, Flutter can be seamlessly integrated into your existing application as a library or module.
While there are numerous resources discussing the utilization of React Native's code in Flutter, 
there appears to be a dearth of information on the inverse scenario, 
that is, incorporating Flutter code into a React Native application.  
In this article series, I'll delve into the process of integrating a Flutter module as a React Native npm package.

Topics covered in the article series:

Article 2: **Render Flutter module alongside React Native components**

Article: [Dev.to](https://dev.to/mazhnik/render-flutter-module-alongside-react-native-components-gk9)

- Rendering Flutter module alongside React Native components for a seamless integration on Web, iOS, and Android platforms.

Article 3: TBD

- Establishing communication between Flutter and React Native.

## Repository structure
### ReactNativeApp
Quite standard React Native Web app. The following changes were made to be able to use with a Flutter module:
- web: `web/webpack.config` was modified to inject `flutter.js` script into `index.html` file.
- web: The rest of the flutter app `rn-flutter/build/web/` is moved to `/flutter`.
- android: maven repositories were added to the `android/build.gradle` file.
- android: `FlutterEngineGroup` is initialized in `MainApplication` to be able to use multiple Flutter modules.
- ios: Flutter frameworks were added using CocoaPods in `ios/Podfile` file.
- ios: `FlutterEngineGroup` is initialized in `AppDelegate` to be able to use multiple Flutter modules.
### cra-app
Standard React app bootstrapped with Create React App. The following changes were made to be able to use with a Flutter module:
- `package.json` has a custom `prebuild` script that copies the Flutter web artifacts from the npm package, so React can find it later.
- `flutter.js` is added using "script" tag in `public/index.html`
### rn-flutter
npm package that takes care of embedding Flutter on Android, iOS and web. 
Used as a dependency in `ReactNativeApp` and `cra-app`.
### flutter_module
Flutter module written in Dart.

- The [pigeon](https://pub.dev/packages/pigeon) plugin is used to generate interop APIs and data classes on mobile.
- `@staticInterop` and `createDartExport` methods are used to allow certain Dart functions to be called from JavaScript


## Main Libraries Used üõ†
Tested with Flutter **3.10** and React-Native **0.72**.
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [React Native Web](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/)
- [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/about)
- [create-react-native-library](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-builder-bob)

## How to run the app

In order to run this app, first prepare `rn-flutter` npm dependency:
```bash
cd rn-flutter

yarn install
# for android, prepares Flutter Android artifacts
yarn android:build
# for ios, prepares Flutter iOS artifacts
yarn ios:build
# for web, prepares Flutter Web artifacts
yarn web:build
# general js code
yarn rn:build

cd ..
```

Then install app's `npm` and cocoapods dependencies
```bash
cd ReactNativeApp

yarn install
# run this if rn-flutter was updated
yarn upgrade-flutter
# run this to install ios dependencies 
yarn install:ios
```

Once you've reached this point, you should be able to run app on all three platforms:

```bash
yarn android
yarn ios
yarn web
```

## Troubleshooting

### Flutter
Ensure your flutter app is properly rebuilt after any changes.  
Run `yarn <platform>:build` script from the `rn-flutter` directory 
for each platform you're testing.

### React Native npm package
Ensure your npm package is properly rebuilt and reinstalled after any changes.  
Run `yarn upgrade-flutter` from the `ReactNativeApp` directory 
and `yarn install:ios` if iOS files were changed.

## Found Libraries Limitations üêû
- [ ] React Native: need to duplicate in host app custom 3rd party maven 
dependencies used in react-native npm module  
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65089494/3rd-party-maven-dependency-in-react-native-npm-module
- [ ] CocoaPods: can't define pod configuration ("Debug" or "Release") in `.podspec` file  
https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2847,  
https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/6338
- [ ] CocoaPods: can't define local directory in the podspec `source` property

- [ ] Flutter: can't display Flutter in multiple elements on web
